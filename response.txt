1. What does each function from the Scanner class do?

- next: Next reads one word only. If I put Thirdy Cue for my nickname, it only reads Thirdy and prints that out. It basically reads string and stops when it detects a space.
- nextLine:
- nextByte:
- nextInt:
- nextBoolean:
- nextFloat:
- nextDouble:
- nextShort:
- nextLong:

2. Think about a use-case for the following functions:

You may enter the use-case after colon or on the next line. Explain why the use-case works.

a. nextInt:
b. nextLine:
c. nextDouble:
d. nextLong:

3. In your own words, why do you think Scanner offers so many different methods to get the input from the user?
